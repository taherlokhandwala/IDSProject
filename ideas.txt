1. Compare number of installs per category to find most popular and least popular categories.

2.

3. We will find the ratio for all apps (number of reviews vs the number installs)
   we will then consider ratios 25-75 percentile and flag the remaining as kinda shady.
   We will then consider the rating that is closest to the median ratio as a bench mark,
   dispose of any apps that lie outside 1.5 IQR, and take the distance between farthest app within
   range. Then we will calculate the percentage of reliability by calculating the ratio between the max dist,
   and the dist between one of the app and ideal app.
